## 4. Functional Requirements

- List of functional requirements  
- One requirement per subsection  
- Title format: `<requirement name> (FR-xxx)`  

Each functional requirement should contain:
- Description: What the system must do  
- Trigger: What starts the action  
- Behavior: Expected system behavior  
- Expected Result: Clear, testable outcome  

**Example:**

### 4.1 Status Overview (FR-001)

Description:  
The system displays the current status of all devices.

Trigger:  
The user opens the dashboard.

Behavior:
- The system retrieves device data  
- The system displays the status of each device  
- Status values include online, offline, and error  

Expected Result:
- All devices are listed  
- Status updates are visible within 5 seconds  
- Offline devices are clearly marked  



## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

- List of non-functional requirements  
- One requirement per subsection  
- Focus on quality attributes and operational constraints (e.g. performance, reliability, security, maintainability, determinism)

**Example:**

### 5.1 Determinism (NFR-001)
