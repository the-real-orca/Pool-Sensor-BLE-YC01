# Functional Specification Document

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

- Business problem or goal
- Why this system or feature exists
- Expected business value

### 1.2 Scope

- What is included
- What is explicitly excluded
- Functional boundaries of the system

### 1.3 Users / Roles

- User groups interacting with the system
- Their responsibilities and level of access

## 2. Functional Summary

### 2.1 Main Workflow / Operating Modes

- Main system workflow
- Main operational states or modes
- High-level process overview

### 2.2 System Architecture

- High-level system structure
- Main software and hardware components
- Component interactions and system boundaries

### 2.3 Hardware Description

- Dedicated computing hardware
- External devices
- Relevant hardware interfaces
- System boundaries, if applicable

### 2.4 Key Components

- Core software and hardware components
- Purpose of each major component

## 3. Definitions (optional)

### 3.1 Terms and Abbreviations

- Domain-specific terms
- Abbreviations used throughout the document
- as a Markdown table
- Sorted alphabetically

## 4. Functional Requirements

- List of functional requirements
- One requirement per subsection
- Title format: `<requirement name> (FR-xxx)`

Each functional requirement should contain:
- What the system must do
- **Trigger:** What starts the action
- **Behavior:** Expected system behavior
- **Expected Result:** Clear, testable outcome

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

- List of non-functional requirements
- One requirement per subsection
- Focus on quality attributes and operational constraints (e.g. Performance,  Reliability, Security, Maintainability Determinism)

## 6. Data

- Main data flow
- Data sources and destinations
- Data formats
- Validation rules
- Storage or persistence, if relevant

## 7. User Interface

- UI structure and behavior
- Screens, views, and interactions
- One subsection per page or major view

## 8. External Dependencies / Integrations

- External systems or services
- Interfaces and exchanged data
- High-level integration behavior

## 9. Permissions (if relevant)

- Access control rules
- Who can view, create, edit, delete, approve, or administer

## 10. Test Cases

- Key scenarios for validation
- One test case per subsection
- Title format: `<test case name> (TC-xxx)`

Each test case should contain:
- What actions are performed
- **Related Requirements:** Linked requirement IDs
- **Pass Criteria:** Clear yes/no criteria

## 11. Open Points / Assumptions

### 11.1 Open Questions

- Unclear or unresolved points
- Issues that still need a decision

### 11.2 Assumptions
