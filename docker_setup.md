# ESP32 Docker Development Environment

This repository provides a comprehensive Docker environment for developing, building, and flashing the project.

## Features
- **Python 3.12**: Modern Python environment.
- **PlatformIO**: Primary build system for this project.
- **Arduino CLI (v0.35.3)**: Alternative build system with `esp32:esp32` and `arduino:avr` cores.
- **ESP-IDF (v5.2)**: For low-level ESP32 development.
- **Node.js 20 & Gemini CLI**: Built-in AI-powered development assistance.
- **Build Tools**: Includes `cmake`, `ninja`, `dfu-util`, and `libusb-1.0-0`.

## 1. Setup

### Start the Container with Docker Compose
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
This will build and start the `yc01-gemini` container in the background.

### Start an Interactive Shell
```bash
docker compose exec -it yc01-gemini bash
```

---

## 2. Usage with PlatformIO (Recommended)

PlatformIO is the preferred way to manage dependencies and build this project.

### Build Project
```bash
docker compose exec yc01-gemini pio run
```

### Clean Build Files
```bash
docker compose exec yc01-gemini pio run -t clean
```

### Flash to Device
Ensure your ESP32 is connected and recognized (usually `/dev/ttyUSB0`).
Since Docker Compose doesn't automatically map your device, use a one-off `docker compose run` command for flashing:
```bash
docker compose run --rm --device=/dev/ttyUSB0 yc01-gemini pio run -t upload
```

#### Windows

Make sure that the USB is accessable to docker.
```PowerShell
usbipd list
usbipd bind --busid <BUSID>
usbipd attach --wsl --busid <BUSID>
```

## 3. Usage with Arduino CLI

If you prefer using the Arduino CLI directly for the `.ino` sketch:

### Compile Sketch
```bash
docker compose exec yc01-gemini \
    arduino-cli compile --fqbn esp32:esp32:esp32doit-devkit-v1 /workspace/src/yc01_ESP32.ino
```

### Upload Sketch
As with PlatformIO, use a one-off `docker compose run` command to access the hardware:
```bash
docker compose run --rm --device=/dev/ttyUSB0 yc01-gemini \
    arduino-cli upload -p /dev/ttyUSB0 --fqbn esp32:esp32:esp32doit-devkit-v1 /workspace/src/yc01_ESP32.ino
```

---

## 4. Usage with Gemini CLI

The environment includes the Gemini CLI for AI assistance. Your Gemini configuration is persisted in the `.gemini` folder in your project directory.

### Run Gemini CLI
```bash
docker compose exec -it yc01-gemini gemini-cli
```

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Permission Denied on /dev/ttyUSB0
If you encounter permission issues when flashing, you might need to add your user to the `dialout` group or use `sudo` (not recommended).
Alternatively, temporarily change permissions:
```bash
sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB0
```

### Docker Compose Container Name
You can check the name of the running container with:
```bash
docker compose ps
```
The service name is `yc01-gemini`.
